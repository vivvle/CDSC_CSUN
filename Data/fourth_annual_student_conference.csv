8,Panel 2;Panel 3;Keynote Speaker: Ciara Lacy,does not apply,It was interesting to learn more about transformative justice and how we can creatively combine different fields of occupation to work towards TJ (computer science to create an app).,This panel taught me that it's not enough to just have representation of minority communities in media if their stories perpetuate stereotypes instead of representing an authentic story. What stood out to me the most was Victoria and Sunny's presentation on representation of the deaf community in Hollywood movies. ,"Ciara Lacy's panel was very eye-opening in seeing how different systems of power and privilege intersect and create the struggle faced by indigenous and native Hawaiians, but most importantly how that same positions inform and drives their resistance to colonial power.

11,Keynote Speaker: Ciara Lacy;Keynote Speaker: Thi Bui,does not apply, does not apply, does not apply,"I've never really thought about the origins of storytelling as a way to rewrite history, so hearing Ciara bring to light the use of stories in this way was quite interesting. I was by her emphasis on the importance of authentic narratives and reclaiming the perspectives the world has about your community","It was so exciting to hear Thi speak after being assigned to read her graphic novel in my AAS 210 course. I enjoyed hearing her explain the origin of her novel and the way her small project grew in tandem with her desire to investigate her family/her own past. It was also quite interesting to hear Thi's insights on the power of gathering real people's perspective's on historical events, and the impact is has made on her storytelling.

13,Panel 1;Panel 2;Panel 3;Keynote Speaker: Ciara Lacy;Keynote Speaker: Thi Bui,Wonderful panel which expanded my understanding of community issues.,I really enjoyed Panel 2 for introducing me to the work Project Rebound is doing.,"V and S presentation introduced me to Audism and expanded my perspective of media representation. H's film was very provocative and well produced, plus I liked the care by which he went through his method and intentions with the audience. But I was most exited to hear A's presentation on the eastern Coachella Valley. That region is one which has long fascinated me with its history and natural beauty, yet equally has revealed many of the starkest gaps in California's standards of living in terms of economic and environmental justice. So to have a scholar from the Coachella Valley give their analysis from a homegrown perspective was really enjoyable and impactful. ","Ciara Lacy was super inspiring. I really enjoyed the way she positioned her presentation as a way to engage creators in the audience, to make them think about what they are doing and how they can continue to elevate their work/meaning. I spent most of the evening after the conference reading about Pacific Islander communities and the many issues facing them.","Thi Bui's presentation was also an enjoyable surprise in that I hadn't expected her to make it biographical. But I was very happy she did decide to format it that way. Not only was I incredibly impressed by the range of spaces and accomplishments Thi Bui has conquered, but I was also struck by the way she made it all seemed so relatable. Another affirmation toward seeking your own path toward social justice even if it seems you're not getting where you want to be at first. ",Excellent,Excellent,Email;Professor,No,I am in Dr. Lai's AAS210 class but I was primarily attending the conference cause I wanted to see what it was about. ,Somewhat convenient,Very much,"I would love to see more presentations on psychogeography, cultural landscapes and suburbanization. American suburbs in particular interest me because many were/are designed to embody White supremacist and colonial fantasies of escapism. Yet shifting demographics (partly caused by urban gentrification) mean that these spaces are now being inherited by people of color and transnational households at a greater rate (which has not go unnoticed by the MAGA crowd and their dogwhistles toward protecting 'suburban housewives'). Since modern, automobile-focused suburban development looks so alien compared to past centuries of populated landscapes, I think a greater focus on contemporary American suburbs would lead to some truly avant-garde takeaways that disrupt the old ""Leave It to Beaver"" cliches.
